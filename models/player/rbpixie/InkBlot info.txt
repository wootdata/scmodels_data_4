For starters, I want to say that this model is not of my creation. 
Any models shown by InkBlot or Zollgro before the 20th of august, 
2000, are reskins of previous models. I just wanted to say that so 
as I don't feel any guilt for posting them. Well, Rainbow Pixie is 
my second Pixie skin based on the ccsakura model. In the model 
viewer the colors were perfect, but in the game I found that some 
were lost, and replaced. No big deal, really, it just looks kinda 
different than I thought it would. I hope you enjoy it, and if you 
have any ideas or suggestions, please E-Mail me at 
pendragon666@worldnet.att.net or leave a review at WON. I do maps 
and sprays, too. Thank you.
