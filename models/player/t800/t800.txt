Terminator Series 800 skin by Teppic8
teppic8@yahoo.com

Chrome Skeleton with red eyes. I made it so you can change the colour of the eyes,
completely by accident! 

Skin info:

chrome: Yes 
Hue shift: yes
animation: unmodified Valve anims

I extracted the skin using Mdlviewer v2.1.0402, and modified it in PSP.

To use, extract the .zip file (camo.bmp and camo.mdl) into valve/models/player/t800/
