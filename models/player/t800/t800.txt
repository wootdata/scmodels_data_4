This is my 2nd model for HL, it is actually the
7th or eight model of t800 i made! This model would
not have been possible without help and tips from
SCARECROW, also thanx 2 all the guys at coldfusion
chatroom for more tips on the model...i had 2 de-beef the legs(slightly twisted) i am a great fan of the movie, so i just had 2 make him.


;Notes from the converter
I simply copied over the animations from the 4.0 Gordon over to this model to make it usable in SvenCoop, some animations might be bugged.
Simply extract the archive to models/players folder inside your SvenCoop installation folder. For example:
C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\accountname\half-life\SvenCoop\models\player\
