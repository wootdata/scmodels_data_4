MODEL: TSUGUMI HIKASHIJUJO
Release 1.02, 03-05-00

- This model is from CYBER TEAM in AKIHABARA like Hibari, my previous model.
  She is a friend hibari studying in the same school. Since she was young, she
  has learned martial arts because of her parents' influence. But she wants
  to be an pop singer.

Comments:

	It takes a whole week to complete this model. Well, this is
	my everyday schedule:

		7.30 	   	get up + head to COM room
		7.30-10.00 	modelling
		break
		10.15-13.00 	modelling
		break
		13.30-16.00 	modelling
		16.00-17.00 	check out coldfusion
		17.00-18.00     watch CYBER TEAM in AKIHABARA :)
		18.00-19.00	modelling
		break
		19.30-22.30	modelling
		end of day.
	
	This is how the hell I work. I spend a day for creating her
	mesh, another day for programming (Team color genernerator), 1.5
 	day for skinning and the rest for 99 animations (Ugh!).
	
	Without this guys help, I couldn't have done this, I am really appreciated.
